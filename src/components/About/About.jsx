        <h4>
          LinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that is
          replacing New York City pay phones with state-of-the-art kiosks called
          Links. Each Link is equipped with free services like high-speed Wi-Fi,
          phone calls, a tablet for maps and city services, and device charging
          for anyone living in or visiting New York City to enjoy. In addition
          to Linkâ€™s features being free to the public, they also come at no cost
          to taxpayers. Links are installed across the five boroughs.
